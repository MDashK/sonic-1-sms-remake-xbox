# Sonic 1 SMS Remake Xbox

A port of the fangame **Sonic 1 SMS Remake** for the **Xbox One | Series S/X** and consequently **UWP**.

**Competition works (only under UWP)! And you can even cross-play between versions PC/Android/PS4/NSW. (check notes below)**

You can install the game in your **Retail Xbox (No DevMode needed)** in the following website: **https://gamr13.github.io/index.html**

Official PC and Android versions on: **sonic-sms-remake.blogspot.com**

**Some notes/Expected bugs and issues:**

1. If the game starts with black borders around, disable your overscan setting in your Xbox settings.
2. Pressing "Start" button makes the screen a little dark, pressing it again goes back to normal. This is not a bug in the game, but in the GMS UWP runner.
3. Competition *works*, **BUT**, UWP players can't create the room for some reason. They can, however, join a room created by other system. Maybe a limitation in GMS UWP networking running on Xbox? This was tested so far only under UWP Windows mode. I wasn't able to get results under DevKit mode.

**UPDATE**: Tested Competition under Xbox Retail mode. Unfortunately, it seems competition is not working there. Maybe a limitation of GMS?
